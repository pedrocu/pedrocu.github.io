# Week 5
## First selection tab 
This was alot more work than I had expected, but worth the late nights.  I expect the other tabs will go much faster now that the first template is done.
I have put underlying data into the table using temporary tricks.  The next step is to develop a solid data model fit for this purpose, likely save to Json and manipulate in Python dics.

# Week 10
## Long time working on the data structures

Sorry not to post pictures for so long.  I was deep into the code, very little was getting done on the GUI, since I wanted to figure out a good way of keep the data in the tabs up to date and make it consistent and easy to "Save" the users work into a file.  I wound up using a JSON format to save and "Open" the data.  This required a lot of work on the basic "sectors" tab along with creating a data object and testing.  After that was done, the next two tabs were pretty stright forward, since I used OOP.

And the "Endowments" tab.

I won't post all my open and save screens, since I used the system GUI and we all know wha that looks like.  Note the default *.json format, that is the format I used to save the data and retrieve it.

And, for good measure, I added an about dialogue.
