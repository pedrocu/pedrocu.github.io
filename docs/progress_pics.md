# Week 5
## First selection tab 
This was alot more work than I had expected, but worth the late nights.  I expect the other tabs will go much faster now that the first template is done.
I have put underlying data into the table using temporary tricks.  The next step is to develop a solid data model fit for this purpose, likely save to Json and manipulate in Python dics.
