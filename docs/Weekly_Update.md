## Week 1
No reporting required

## Week 2

1. What did you do last week?
    - Read all the course descriptions and requirements
    - Coded and posted web pages on github
    - Wrote questions and responded on piazza
    - Drafted a project proposal
    - Read background materials for proposal 
2. What do you plan to do this week?
    - Refine proposal, post, get comments feedback
    - Identify resources materials, online, textbooks etc.
    - Read more background materials to identify potential stumbling blocks
    - Develop reading list for coming weeks to sync tasks with new knowledge
3. Are there any impediments in your way?
    - Summer!   Really, summer requires extra attention to putting in the time required.  Keeping a good tempo will be important
4. What were the processes you used last week, how can you make the process work better? 
    -   I reviewed the requirements and made a list of tasks, which was a bit iterative.  One of the mistakes I always make in CSPB courses is not looking ahead to next weekâ€™s assignments, before making up a workplan.  Often the following week's task or description provides important information relevant to the current week's work.  Be tactical and strategic, look ahead.

## Week 3

1. What did you do last week?
    - Finalized proposal
    - Developed work schedule
    - Downloaded and read PyQt books (4 chapters)
    - Downloaded and started to read OOP documentation
    - Wrote first PyQt code to create dialogue box
    - Fixed up git website (added Jekyll config file)
2. What do you plan to do this week?
    - Plan application layout
    - Consider open-source issues (what will make my app attractive for others to use\contribute)
    - Develop main screen for application
    - Keep reading PytQt documentation
    - Look at linked-in
3. Are there any impediments in your way?
    - Main issue is time.  Being Summer and my son is in day camp, I have short days to work with.  
4. What were the processes you used last week; how can you make the process work better? 
    -   Setting a work agenda is key, as it allows me to just sit down and start working, not wonder first about what I must do.  
    -   Make setting weekly work agenda on Monday priority (this is rather detailed list)
    -   Check the agenda again on Wednesday (in most cases I can add to it)

## Week 4

1. What did you do last week?
    - Read PyQT (3 chapters)
    - Started repo for my program files
    - Started reading OOP
    - Findshed app layout (this will be modified as I go along, but it is a broad brush to keep focused)
    - Developed main screen for application
    - Continue to improve github web site 
2. What do you plan to do this week?
    - Finish first tab to read in database location and specifications
    - Develop methods for saving settings from one session to the other (use PyQt Settings class)
    - Start second tab for sectors (work on PyQt data API)
    - Work on linked-in
3. Are there any impediments in your way?
    - Reading and working on code is a great combo, theory and applications work well for me, but application often requires more then just theory, it require experience. 
4. What were the processes you used last week; how can you make the process work better? 
    -   Setting a work agenda is key, as it allows me to just sit down and start working, not wonder first about what I must do.  
    -   Get more reading in at odd hours (down time) by having it on mulitple computers synched up
