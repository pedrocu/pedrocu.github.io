    - Read background materials for proposal

    - Read more background materials to identify potential stumbling blocks
    - Develop reading list for coming weeks to sync tasks with new knowledge
3. Are there any impediments in your way?
    - Summer!   Really, summer requires extra attention to putting in the time required.  Keeping a good tempo will be important
4. What were the processes you used last week, how can you make the process work better? 
    -   I reviewed the requirements and made a list of tasks, which was a bit iterative.  One of the mistakes I always make in CSPB courses is not looking ahead to next weekâ€™s assignments, before making up a workplan.  Often the following week's task or description provides important information relevant to the current week's work.  Be tactical and strategic, look ahead.
