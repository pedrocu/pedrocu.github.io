# Vision Statement
* Developing a desktop application (user interface);
* Learning how to do basic parallel processing via threads and queues;
* Understanding how to handle open source publishing and licenses (GNU etc.)
* Greater depth of experience with object programming concepts such as inheritance and Python development tools such as built in interables. In general, take general Python skills to the next level.
# Background
I'm an economist with a great deal of background in international economic analysis.  I regularly conduct analysis of global economic policies (such as trade agreements, climate change, poverty and food security).   You can see some of my research at: https://impactecon.com/resources/working-papers/.
# Idea
I want to develop an open source application (GUI) to automate and facilitate routine tasks in the analysis of global economic data.  There are a number of data tasks which must be undertaken before a global economic study can be undertaken. Many of the tasks are routine and are currently done via "batch" files which run data programs which can take a long time to run (asynchronous).  Moreover, the processes is subject to errors, due to the complexities of running command line programs which processes user input in the form of text files.  I would like to create a Python application which incorporates these process into a GUI. 

# Motivation
I have wanted to do these things since first entering CSPB several years ago and now, alas, I have the chance to do it. Interestingly, I had developed a research proposal around these ideas which I submitted to a conference a few months ago.  It was accepted by the conference reviewers, but I was too busy to follow up.  This course is the perfect place to continue down that road and eventually present my own open source project which I hope will be helpful to the general research and code community (economics) and help prospective employers assess my skills and abilities outside of a resume and\or degrees.
